# Building-University-Database
Created an entity-relationship diagram that maps different infrom
Implemented an SQL schema that creates front-end web app with Flask and HTML that accesses a hypothetical university database that lets users access course information through different secured and inaccessible queries. Application ran locally on Google Cloud. The file used to create the web app with Python and Flask can be found [here](https://github.com/jat2211/Building-University-Database/blob/main/server.py) (all code written by me is in lines 78-883). The directory containing all HTML files used to display each query [here](https://github.com/jat2211/Building-University-Database/tree/main/templates).
